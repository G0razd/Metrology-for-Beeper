# Metrology for Beeper

Metrology is a series of app customizations and redesigns aimed at bringing a bold, clear, and consistent user experience to [various Windows and Android apps](https://github.com/Madelena?tab=repositories&q=Metrology), such as Home Assistant, MusicBee, and more. Its design language is based on [Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)) and [Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) design systems pioneered by Microsoft Design since the 2010s.

This is a theme for [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/), a brand-new universal chat client!

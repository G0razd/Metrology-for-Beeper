# Metrology for Beeper

Metrology is a series of app customizations and redesigns aimed at bringing a bold, clear, and consistent user experience to [various Windows and Android apps](https://github.com/Madelena?tab=repositories&q=Metrology), such as Home Assistant, MusicBee, and more. Its design language is based on [Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)) and [Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) design systems pioneered by Microsoft Design since the 2010s.

This is a theme for [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/), a brand-new universal chat client!

## How to Install

To install, simply copy and paste [the CSS code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Madelena/Metrology-for-Beeper/main/Metrology-for-Beeper.css) to the Custom CSS box under Settings > Appearances, and you're all set.

As theming for Beeper is still at an early stage of development, so any new updates may break the theme. As a precaution, the app will reset to the base theme every time the app is restarted. You will need to go back into Settings > Appearance and press the Apply button to reapply the theme each time.
